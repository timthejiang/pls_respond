It appears that Sam has played a joke on everyone! See, there are filters on the site, and the way they work is, you tell the filters that if they type a certain word in, it would change it to what you specify. For example if you type in ""shit"" it would change it to ""s***"" or whatever you want. I told Sam that he should not do this, I shouldn't have told him what it was in the first place. It's my fault, sorry. Does ""f******"" appear wherever you place the word ""the""? I will talk to Sam right now and fix this. "

1193006796.0	6368.0	False	Ok, so the excel file is out date is our group's data for the time the can is heated. Austin, Nelson O, KC, Amy, and James but James wasn't there. They told me to write a paragraph on our results so here it is. We found that the sweet spot for time the can is left on the hot plate was the control. If you heat it longer, the water evaporates and there is no hot water left to crush the can. However the biggest can crush was from the 180 second test where the can crushed 76% or 270mL. I think with further testing we could have added more water and heated it longer and gotten a bigger crush. Also we observed the can crushes better when you flip it in to the tub of water faster. Also, Kyle, put the averages of the trials in to your graphing calculator (stat button -> edit) and calculate the cubic regression and then find the minimum/maximum (depends if you graphed the percent or mL). This shows you the best value for the time you should heat the can. I got 78 secs on my calculator. Try doing this on other groups results. If you need help with the powerpoint, I have powerpoint 2007.

1229916686.0	25610.0	False	"if you can find somewhere where you can buy that illuminated keyboard, im sure you can just swap it out. ive taken apart plently of laptops. usually the keyboard is just a big plastic square with a ribbon connector attached to the logic board. However, the backlit keyboard needs the ambient light sensor which might not be on your model. does the screen backlight adapt to ambient light? if it does, your macbook already has the ambient light sensor in which case you could probably just swap out the keyboard. if not, you could always just manually turn on the key backlighting. in any case, i never look at my keyboard when i type, but im sure this is all about the ""cool"" factor of having a backlit keyboard. see you tomorrow morning.

And yet again, there is another problem...sometimes when I get out of the car, it smells like burnt oil (i think, i dont know what burnt oil smells like), and at night, I can see a little bit of smoke through the headlight beams. it isn't constant smoke and it doesn't always happen. i guess ill have to bring it in again, could this be a serious problem or could i wait to get it fixed?

Career Planning is a developmental, thought-provoking process. You must examine yourself: your interests, your temperament, and your values. You then need to think about what you want in a job. 1. *Establish Tentative Personal/Career Goals * Write them in terms of short range and long range objectives, with an emphasis on what you plan to do after high school. Remember, you must continue your education and training beyond high school in order to supp= ort the life style you want. 2. *Discuss Your Career Goals With Counselors, Teachers, & Family* Ask their advice, and encourage their input so you can evaluate their suggestions and ideas along with your own. 3. *Explore Occupations and Gather Career Information* Store your collection of materials, articles, and pamphlets in a loose leaf binder or scrapbook. Find out what education or additional training will be required to pursue the careers of your choice. 4. *Conduct Informational Interviews* Talk with people who are working in occupations that interest you. Consider using a tape recorder to take notes. Ask your counselors or par= ents to assist you in arranging field trips to see various work environments. 5. *Develop a Resume of Activities, Honors, and Achievements * This can be used later when you apply for part-time jobs and volunteer t= o work in community and civic activities. 6. *Assemble a List of Admission Requirements and Qualifications* This list will assist you in determining how competitive you are. Two an= d four-year colleges, military organizations, and trade schools have entra= nce requirements. Collect college catalogs and other brochures.

1242242498.0	34570752.0	False	Hey Leblanc/Race, I'm here at U of I for my summer internship (i know my mom told u already like 10 times). On the first day when we were introducing ourselves, our advisor told us all to brag about one thing. I said I had a 4:37 mile and the kid next to me says, darn i cant brag about my 4:41. So we've been running together. It turns out he has a friend in the Illini running club so he is on their mailing list. They have a summer running program here too. Yesterday I went on a run with him and Mike Brothers, the guy in charge of the competitive running club here. It was a lot of fun. How is summer running going over there? Happy Fathers day this weekend! Nelson

Yes, I was very big on running in high school. I wasn't that good at swimming, I mostly did it to stay in shape over the winter. I run a lot I actually already joined a competitive running club at U of I because I'm on campus for the summer. I was invited for a summer internship. I am about to finish taking Chem 102/103. I also got to do research with a professor. Glenbrook North has about 2100 students in a town of 35000. I liked my hometown and my high school but I am really enjoying U of I this summer.

1278678019.0	5288349.0	True	"Specs are good for that laptop but screen resolution is killer, at least for me. I have 1280x800 screen right now which is basically the same thing but 16:10 aspect ratio. It is awful. Every single second I wish my screen resolution was higher. Also I'd look on craigs. there a lot of people who don't know the value of their laptops or there might be good ""stolen"" ones like mine. Also AMD quad core laptops if they exist, you aren't getting more than 1 hr of battery life. 6lbs may be good for that size but who know what battery life is like. Find a good review of that laptop. Find a laptop with optimus. Also nvidia announced their next get graphics cards the other day and they all have optimus.

1284025515.0	13851.0	True	"nice, girl or boy? anyways all these laptops have crap resolution. my PERSONAL guidelines for resolutions are 1920x1080 or higher for 16.5""+ 1600x900 for 14""+ newegg used to have several $800-$900 comps with 15"" screens and full 1080p i dunno what happened to them. that is just me. all these laptop look to be exactly the same but with a different case. they all probably have crap battery life and like i told yo= u nvidia just came out with new mobile gpus these laptops all have core-i5 mobile processors so i assume thats what you are looking for. however i would strongly suggest looking at the sony vaio = P series on their website. itll cost you more than these (starts at $1000) bu= t in my opinion it worth it because it has core i7 quad plus for $100 more yo= u can upgrade to full 1080p. dell's studio 15 laptops are within the $800 price range and can be upgraded to 1080p. look at those on their website. currently my favorite laptop that exists is the vaio z series. google it, its epic but super expensive but i know ur rich. i still believe that craigs is the best place to get a deal. but you can't be stupid. dont email the people that put their email on a picture. only us= e the craigs anonymous email thing.

1284838197.0	376356.0	True	"Nelson and Jung, 1) First step, installing python and several needed tools: Please install in your computers : python, ipython, numpy, scipy and matplotlib. - If you have a ""linux"" distro you can very easily select those packages = from the synaptic's GUI and install them - If you have a ""Mac"" Os X operating system you can follow this = instructions: - If you have a windows operating system you can read the following = instructions: 2) Be familiar with those tools. Suggestion: Start python with pylab: - in linux, and mac: $ ipython pylab - in windows, start from the meny ""pylab"" This will include all the libraries from python, numpy and matplotlib to = the environment.

Research: Stage 1: - Based on the paper Prof. Kudeki sent, generate a ""fake"" , ""custom"" = ionosphere based on the parameters explained there. It should be like a = function: Ne(h) , where Ne is the electron density and ""h"" is the = height. Please do some examples of that and generate a report with the = parameters used, and some 2D-plots. with some assumed values for the = parameters. Stage 2: - Also explained in the paper, based on that ""custom"" ionosphere = generate the X and O mode curves, and plot those 2D curves in the same = graph. Stage 3: (forward model) - Generate some variance to the actual virtual height of the X and O = modes. As prof.

This is actually an iterative = process, when the ""forward model"" is called several times by the = inverting algorithm adjusting all the parameters in order to obtain the = best ""fitting"" of the measured data with the ""proposed"" parameters. - with the obtained parameters, we can generate the electron density = profile Ne(h) for a specific ionogram.

1287330874.0	108367.0	True	Hey Tom, I learned a lot from the showcase. Thanks for opportunity and for the last minute help! I wish it was timed better with webos 2.0. I can't remember the link to the survey but I wanted to share some of my thoughts and experiences. It is very hard to find good resources for developing on webos. When I developed for Android, there were hundreds of great books written on the topic. WebOS has two. I got one (Oreilly's palm webos) and it was very poor and the example code in the book had very obvious mistakes in it. So I dumped the book and just relied on web resources which were also very poor. Your developer website is fine, but I like to see examples of code in use. It really helps to see actual pieces of code from examples rather than just how a service works. This is mostly because I had never written a line of javascript before in my life or made a website. Your development platform is probably very good for developers coming from web apps but not so good for others. It would be helpful to have a website link and guide for developers coming from C or Java or android. You already have one for iPhone developers and web developers. Another thing is that there is no spellcheck or useful autocompletion in eclipse and the plug in isn't as well integrated as the android one. This may be fixed in webos 2.0 I haven't checked yet. What do you (or others) use to develop internally or what would you recommend? I used eclipse mainly because that was what I was familiar with because I have made apps for android in the past. Also the palm github is a great idea for new developers like me, but the Services example app does not work for creating calendar appointments or any of the calendar services. The last time it was updated was in December 15, 2009. Back to webos 2.0, I installed the sdk (I haven't really taken a look at it yet) and it never asked for a restart. I tried out the emulator and it worked fine. When I restarted my computer everything was messed up. I'm on windows 7 64-bit. It was as if my whole UI got reset. It is hard to explain, shortcuts had no icons, half of my desktop shortcuts were gone, my system tray applications didn't start up. Settings were different and elements of the windows 7 ui not what they should (close button was smaller, dragging windows only gave me an outline). I can give you more detail if you need. It may not have been caused by the palm sdk or it may have, I'm not really sure, I just know that it happened after I rebooted after installing the SDK. When I rebooted again, everything was back to normal, so its all good now, but it was really scary at the time. I understand it is beta software so stuff like this happens. So, enough of my troubles for now. I think I might try to remake my app with webOS 2.0 when I have the time. I think it will work a lot better then. I'll let you know how it goes! Cheers, Nelson Osacky

So, try to get what o mode and x modes are, and the propagation speeds of them. We'll try to look into those and work on the next step from the next meeting I'll contact you before long regarding when the next meeting is gonna be, which should be held before the thanksgiving break. Anyway, have a great weekend :)

So i had her install wheres my droid from the android market on the browser and this app to help her find her phone. It will force gps and wifi on whenever you get a text message. I actually leave gps setting on and wifi on on my phone all the time because it will only use battery when an app requests battery. My app does not request location so it doesn't use any battery. There are no settings or anything for it because otherwise when you lose the phone the person who finds it will be able to change it. So in short, the only purpose of this app is to install it after you have lost your phone. I have other planned features for it, but right now that is just how it is.

1303487590.0	1364.0	True	I sincerely apologize for this error. You are not the first person to notice this. However, RIM has not given me a physical playbook to test on. I do believe this is a bug in the underlying framework and not the app itself however I cannot confirm this. Hopefully a firmware update will fix this. Furthermore, I developed this app using a free trial of adobe flash builder. The reason I developed using this software is that it is the only mature development platform for the playbook. My free trial has now expired and I am not going to pay $250 for this software when it is the software to develop android and iphone app is 100% free. They also have larger markets and audiences. I am not frustrated with you, I hope it doesn't sound like that. I am frustrated with RIM. Their development tools are the most expensive and the worst on the market.

1310002313.0	1102.0	True	these are the two phone i would have recommended in the first place: 1. the htc hd7 it is a windows phone 7 series. windows phone 7 is far simpler and more intuitive to use than android. pick one up in the store and see just how easy to use it is. i think it would be perfect for you. 2. htc sensation this is a beast. probably the best android phone out right now. it has a high resolution screen which may make certain things too small for you to see (but they are very sharp) 3. mytouch 4g slide it has what they say is the best camera on a phone. it also has a slide out keyboard if you miss those solid keys. it should be out before the end of this month. i would only wait for this if you really need a physical keyboard. pick them up in a store. try to make a call, search through contacts, check email, and take a picture. see which one is the easiest to use. it doesn't matter how many features the phone has if you can't use them. also, all of these phones happen to use the qualcomm snapdragon processor im working with over here. but thats not why i picked them.

1313073167.0	86292.0	True	"Hey Kinson, I thought you were a really good mentor. Since you used to be an intern, you remember what it was like and you gave me good feedback. I think that the only areas for improvement would be more help in breaking down my task. Shashank did a good job of this, but unfortunately he was very busy. He also had more experience with ADB. I guess it would help if my mentor was someone who knew how to execute my project. You did spend a lot of time with me. I really appreciate that. I know you guys are very busy with real work and I know you cut out a lot of time to help me. Thanks again for all the help! I had a great time in San Diego this week.

1320730324.0	315119.0	True	Hey, Sorry it took a while to respond. I really have no idea how much software development costs. As for having an online component with a database, it should be too hard. Amazon's EC2, Microsoft Azure and Google's AppEngine can all provide a scalable online database for your webapp. As for the app itself, it seems relatively straightforward. As for contacts, I'm head of a mobile development club here at U of I. Most of the students in it are inexperienced, but I can certainly ask if any would be interested. Good luck on the project! Regards, Nelson PS Will you be back at Qualcomm? I'm not sure if I'll be back yet.

I've made numerous apps, only one is currently on the market. It is called SMS Enabler and it allows you to control your phone with text messages. For example, you can turn the ringer on with a text message, among other features. I also made an app that reminds you to bring your umbrella on a rainy day using a notification. I pulled it from the market because it had a bug. I plan to re-release it soon. I am also working on an app for a startup company called StageBloc. The app allows you to manage your StageBloc site from an android phone. > How would you describe your and Jonathan's relationship? We have our ups and downs like all brothers. > What do you think of Jonathan's GBN app? How do you think he did making it? I'm quite proud of him. For a first app, it is impressive. > How do you think Jonathan will succeed at making apps or anything related to > that? If he puts the time in, he will be very successful. There are a lot of opportunities available to Android developers. > How do you think you influenced him in his decision to make the app? I bought him an Android programming book for his birthday and told him to read it. I also reminded him to read it when I saw it was gathering dust. > How did you help him in the process of making the app? (If you didn't, have > you helped him before with things like that?)

1327086005.0	6434.0	True	"Hi Chris, I probably should have asked you guys about the proper procedure for checking out before going on break. However, nobody had signed a sublease at that time so I gave my keys to Sunny before leaving in case somebody did sublease. I trusted Sunny, perhaps it was a mistake. I figured that this person would sign a sublease before moving in so you guys could check my room/apartment. Please go in to my room and do a check so that Dan is held responsible for any damages (it is the room on the right, I'm calling it my room until he signs the sublease). I have never communicated with this guy before yesterday. In fact, I was surprised to find someone was living in my room when I arrived yesterday because nobody had signed the lease. Sunny has already given the keys to Dan. My room was clean before I left. As for the mattress, I was using a mattress cover as well as a blanket on top of it, there should be nothing wrong with the mattress. Please feel free to check it for any damage. If there were damage, Dan would have noticed it before putting his sheets on it. The fact that this guy is in my room without signing anything makes me very uncomfortable. I am entrusting you to please make sure this sublease is signed as soon as possible. By monday, he will have stayed in my apartment for one week without any agreement or payment. Did he make any attempts to sign the lease before I showed up yesterday? I'm sorry you have to be in this position. I'll try to respond to emails or calls as fast as possible, feel free to call me if anything arises. I will be leaving this country on Sunday, January 22nd. If you need to contact me after that date, cc my father on any emails sent to me, or call him. I will be sending you a separate email with his contact details.

I need to style up the app more and then retrieve info from the server. I think I'll probably be taking a break from the app for a bit while I travel to India and get settled in Hong Kong. I'm free any time today or tomorrow, but I'm busy packing and doing last minute preparations sp I don't think I'll get any more done from the app. Nelson On Fri, Jan 20, 2012 at 11:24 AM, Adam Carney <adambcarney@gmail.com> wrote: > My account name is adambcarney.

1327599224.0	73167.0	False	Dear Google user, We're getting rid of over 60 different privacy policies across Google and replacing them with one that's a lot shorter and easier to read. Our new policy covers multiple products and features, reflecting our desire to create one beautifully simple and intuitive experience across Google. We believe this stuff matters, so please take a few minutes to read our updated Privacy Policy and Terms of Service at http://www.google.com/policies. These changes will take effect on March 1, 2012. One policy, one Google experience __________________________________________________________________ Easy to work across Google Our new policy reflects a single product experience that does what you need, when you want it to. Whether you're reading an email that reminds you to schedule a family get-together or finding a favorite video that you want to share, we want to ensure you can move across Gmail, Calendar, Search, YouTube, or whatever your life calls for with ease. Tailored for you If you're signed into Google, we can do things like suggest search queries =96 or tailor your search results =96 based on the interests you've expressed in Google+, Gmail, and YouTube. We'll better understand which version of Pink or Jaguar you're searching for and get you those results faster. Easy to share and collaborate When you post or create a document online, you often want others to see and contribute. By remembering the contact information of the people you want to share with, we make it easy for you to share in any Google product or service with minimal clicks and errors. __________________________________________________________________ Protecting your privacy hasn't changed Our goal is to provide you with as much transparency and choice as possible, through products like Google Dashboard and Ads Preferences Manager, alongside other tools. Our privacy principles remain unchanged. And we'll never sell your personal information or share it without your permission (other than rare circumstances like valid legal requests). Got questions? We've got answers. Visit our FAQ at http://www.google.com/policies/faq to read more about the changes. (We figured our users might have a question or twenty-two.) __________________________________________________________________ Notice of Change March 1, 2012 is when the new Privacy Policy and Terms will come into effect. If you choose to keep using Google once the change occurs, you will be doing so under the new Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. Please do not reply to this email.

1329205013.0	224269.0	False	Hey! Hong Kong is a pretty crazy city. You can find almost anything here. I'm meeting a ton of people from all over the world. There are about 200 exchange students. A lot of them are french so I've been trying to practice my french. (and the french girls have nice accents) Last weekend I was in Macau which is the Las Vegas of the east. Every time I went in a casino, the security would let everyone in except they'd stop me to ask for ID. I lost HKD 100 on roulette (about USD 14). It was a really fun weekend. There's lots of drinking every day. It's going to make me broke. Every Tuesday night, an expatriate bar has HKD 10 vodka mixed drinks which is a bit more than a USD. No tax, no tip! I think I drank more in the first two weeks here than I have the rest of my life combined. Luckily I haven't thrown up yet, but I got rather close on the taxi ride home Tuesday. My classes are not as good as I expected. You've probably seen my facebook posts about the ridiculous things my professors have said. My classes are pass fail though so I just need to get a C-. At least I've been learning a lot about the local culture and also european culture. Most classes have no homework assignments or quizzes just one midterm and one final which is pretty nice. I haven't done any work or reading yet (even though I should have). Hong Kong > San Diego. I hope you aren't too jealous. Do you have any stories from your semester? I hope your semester isn't too boring. At least you are almost done. Don't know the results on Khan Academy. I had my 5th interview last week and I haven't gotten a response since then. Box.net also offered to fly me to Palo Alto, but they made the offer 3 days before I left. So I had a skype interview instead and I was rejected. :( Have you gotten any other offers? Still stuck at Qualcomm? It isn't so bad anyways! Cheers!

The business plan competition here has a limit of 5 team members so one of you will need. Here are the details: http://onemilliondollar.ust.hk/ I attached the intent to compete form which needs to be signed by 5 of us. Could you guys return that to me by the end of your Feb 27? There is also an entry fee of HKD 300 (about USD 40). I'll take care of the fee. Looks like you guys are getting ready for Cozad? Keep up the good work!

1330369660.0	9695.0	True	ACM has free printing and scanning. If I forge the signatures that will cause problems if we win. I don't want a company founded on forged signatures. I signed using adobe pdf I didn't have to print anything (but you have to upload your signature using a scanner or camera).

1330399865.0	15495.0	True	Hey all! Kurtis: Whatever is the easiest way for all of you to sign it is best. Adam: A couple of little edits for the business plan that I noticed are below. They are out of order, sorry. 1. my last name is Osacky 2. chief is spelled wrong next to kurtis's name, and i believe his title should be chief technology officer (not office) 3. in the business model section, i feel that the fourth sentence, as well as some of the information contained is slightly redundant. although, there is a lot of redundant info throughout, perhaps that is per the rules of the business plan competition? 4. the last paragraph of the executive summary and the progress and milestones section appear to be in conflict (number of restaurants) 5. the 30-50% statistic appears twice throughout, once in executive summary and then right after in problem 6. the solution section, appears to me to be redundant. the product description that follow is a much more concise way of explaining it. 7. missing livingsocial in competition? Anyways, here is a link to the 2 page version for the business competition here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NmTjnJhhcdsZu1SMMCkyUH7MFoiWh1_WiXRHYx4D6V4/edit Feel free to take a look and try to remove unnecessary things so we can fit it on to 2 pages. Otherwise, I think I will just make the margins slightly larger. Adam, Could you pretty it up please? The full length business plan looks quite nice! Do you guys need me to get some work done on the Android side of things by any specific date? Let me know. I can't promise anything though. zzzz time for me to sleep On Tue, Feb 28, 2012 at 1:32 AM, Kurtis Nusbaum <knusbau2@illinois.edu> wrote: > Wait, aren't we supposed to print off one copy and then all sign it? > > > On 2/27/12 9:47 AM, Robert Pieta wrote: > > Here is my info and signature. > (so *nose*). > > Robert Pieta > > > On Feb 27, 2012, at 1:38 AM, Nelson wrote: > >> Well, if we're doing noes goes, how about the last person print it, >> sign it and email it back loses?

1330431197.0	28724.0	True	Hi, I was booking flights for my spring break trip to vietnam, cambodia, and thailand. If I use my debit card, there is an extra fee for exchanging the money from USD to HKD. However in order to use your credit card, I would need the last four digits of your social security number (there is an extra verification step because of the location, I think). Should I use my debit card? I can pay you back if I use your credit card. Nelson 
1330456626.0	82658.0	True	Ok. I'll do my best to get something done. Also, I just submitted to the HKUST Entrepreneurship competition.

1330431197.0	150614.0	True	I bought the tickets that were priced in USD on my card and the ones in foreign currency on your card, which should have only been 1 set of tickets. However, the third tickets I tried to purchase were denied on my card, so I bought it on yours instead. So I ended up buying a total of around $300 of tickets on your credit card.

1330891176.0	2969.0	True	Just an update on a rather important back-end issue that I want to make sure everyone is on the same page about. I realized a week or so ago that we have no current way to associate and image/logo with a given business or food pantry. Robert brought this to my attention with regards to the mobile app, but I know Taylor was also aware of this because he was just using the same image for every business on the front end. I have a very clear plan on how to add this functionality, but it will take about 1-3 hours to execute. I just wanted to make sure everyone knew that I was indeed aware of the problem and that I have a known fix for it. The issue is that I have an mp, midterm exam, and EOH in the comming week. Needless to say, my time is going to be crunched in the next week. What I can say for sure is that this functionality will be implemented before I leave for spring break. If I had to make a guess, I'd say I'll have the problem fixed by this Saturday night. But no promises. P.S. Drew, I'm going to use this awesome tool called South (http://south.aeracode.org/docs/about.html). Cole told me about it, I tried it out on another Django project I'm doing, and it works quite awesomely. Basically we're just going to add one field to the Business model and one field to the Pantry model.

1331683728.0	26121.0	True	"OK. I ordered you a memory card along with the camera and the book. You should have them all by friday so you can test them out this weekend. A phone that I wanted to buy is on sale on groupon hong kong for HKD 3688 which is USD 475. If I buy it with my debit card, chase will charge me 3%. I'd like your permission to use your credit card so I don't have to pay that fee, but then I am in debt to you again. I really should have gotten a credit card before leaving.

1331641911.0	107046.0	True	Nelson, To give you an update, we have been moving at a fairly relaxed pace. Everyone is busy and I continue to get more client work and am trying to involve the team as much as possible as subcontractors to make a little money. We didn't make the semi-finals of Cozad. We were pretty sloppy in getting the demo together. We are almost certainly going to be in Illinois over summer. I'm talking with my two friends who also do client side stuff for the redesign agency about getting an apartment in a neighborhood on the outskirts of chicago to continue to pursue new clients and start to test TGM in a few restaurants. It sounds like Kurtis also may be joining us in this. This seems to be a good option because we will have a team of developers, as well as a team of 3 people devoted only to pursuing new business and selling TGM. Let me know if there's anything you need from me. Pretty soon I will send you all the design files you will need for the app. Hope you are having fun in Hong Kong. -Adam On Tue, Mar 13, 2012 at 7:31 AM, Kurtis Nusbaum <klnusbaum@gmail.com> wrote: > Test server is up at goodmarket.us.

1329440627.0	3513929.0	True	Yeah, those dates are fine. I get back April 10th and I'll try to get my homework done on April 11 so I can spend time with you. The only problem I see with those dates is that you won't spend a weekend in Hong Kong, but I usually go out most nights so it isn't a problem. I'll be in Macau on April 14th to see LMFAO (a band). I'll probably go off with my friends to see them that night while you gamble in the Casinos. Unless you want to see LMFAO, but I don't think that's for you.

1332978348.0	64621.0	True	You can get anywhere with public transportation but cabs are also really cheap. I'll probably be able to meet you somewhere since you arrive at night. You can email me once you are here because there is free wifi at the airport. If you don't have an unlocked phone, ask tmobile for the unlock code. You can buy a SIM at any 7 11 store for about 9usd and then you can put it in your unlocked phone. Otherwise, I know where to get an unlocked phone here for like 25usd. Another thing you can do is get an app called whatsapp in the android market. You will need wifi or data to use it though. It will let you text me for free. Studies are fine. I finished midterms last week. Nelson On Thursday, March 29, 2012, s o wrote: > You'll have to let me know whether there is public transportation or cab > from the airport to the hotel.

1334092335.0	23969.0	True	"So there are a few ways to get there because hong kong's public transportation is so good. The first is airport express/taxi. The second is the airport bus which stops a block away from your hotel, and the third is just to take a taxi all the way. I describe the three options below. After you get through customs, you will find a money exchange which will also let you buy airport express and bus tickets. Most people at the airport should speak english, but some taxi drivers may not. You don't tip taxi drivers or anybody here. All signs at the airport are in english so it should be easy to follow. I would exchange about US$50 to US$100. You can exchange the rest of your money later at a better rate. You wont need an octopus card if they ask you (I'll let you use my extra student one which will give you 50% off on the subway system called MTR) Let me know which option you are picking so I can time my arrival at your hotel. I think you will probably arrive by 10pm with either option. http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=3DHong+Kong+International+Airport&daddr= =3DEaton+Smart+Hong+Kong,+Yau+Ma+Tei,+Hong+Kong&hl=3Den&ll=3D22.304979,114.= 162025&spn=3D0.225202,0.41851&sll=3D22.321655,114.05236&sspn=3D0.225175,0.4= 1851&geocode=3DFaKBVAEdD4LKBiECPjApH7mJBQ%3BFQllVAEdzR_OBiFfhKBQnqYBwCnFOJt= w6gAENDGSmwjy17d_8w&t=3Dh&gl=3Dus&dirflg=3Dr&ttype=3Dnow&noexp=3D0&noal=3D0= &sort=3Ddef&mra=3Dltm&z=3D12&start=3D3 You can take the airport express to kowloon. it should cost hkd 90 for a one way ticket. from there you can take a taxi to your hotel or a bus. since you don't know the stop numbers, i'd go with the taxi, which should cost less than hkd40. so that option should be less than hkd140. The airport express is a really nice train. You can take the airport bus, a22 to your hotel. this is the cheapest option at hkd 33, but might take a little longer. you would get off at nanking street and nathan road (the stop is called nathan hotel). get off when you see a mall to your right with a big sign that says called ""wing on"" when you get off, you just walk one block to your left, which is north and you will see your hotel there. Maybe the best option but most expensive option is just to take a taxi from the airport. this should cost less than hkd 180. but saves the headache of getting lost, unless your taxi driver can't speak English. 2012/4/10 Nelson <nellyspageli@gmail.com> > Confirmation email.

1333740283.0	443856.0	False	I agree that some challenges would arise with the RSOs, but I think we can still benefit from it if we are launching in the Urbana-Champaign area at some point (not necessarily first). At the very least, it'll provide good marketing and get our app into student's hands- the more students we have using our app the more valuable we'll be to local businesses. It could also provide a good test case and give us some real numbers (ie $ amount of food saved, number of installed apps, etc.). Who cares if our app breaks for some RSO? We can use them to test the input process, how people use the app, etc. TLDR: Lets not spend time on it now, but I wouldn't completely rule it out for the future.

I have tried connecting to the playbook using wifi share but I can't seem to find any files related to the Notepad application. Any help you might be able to provide would be greatly appreciated.

Here are some Japanese phrases to memorize on the plane. This post is dedicated to Sarah Menkedick, who is currently learning Japanese in Nagoya, Japan. SOME OF THESE JAPANESE phrases are practical. Some of them are funny. All 10 will greatly enhance your trip to Japan. All of the phrases are pretty informal, especially the one about crapping your pants. Note that I spell the phrases phonetically in the bold text, but spell them with the most common romanization of the Japanese characters when explaining a point. Confused already? Don=92t worry about it. Keitai girl by scion02 1. =93Yo-ro-sh-ku o-neh-gai-shi-mus.=94 This phrase is absolute magic. Say =93yoroshiku=94 to any Japanese person in any situation and they will help you with anything and everything you need. It=92s impossible to translate literally, but means something to the effect of =93please do your best and treat me well=94. If you memorize nothing else before going to Japan, remember =93yoroshiku=94 and you=92re totally set. =93Onegaishimasu=94 is a common w= ord that means something similar to =93please=94. 2. =93Yosh. Gahn-bah-di-mus.=94 This phrase means something like, =93OK, I=92m going for it,=94 or =93I=92l= l do my best=94. A Japanese would say =93Ganbarimasu=94 before taking a test, or leaving the house for a job interview. Japanese people will crack up if you say it before walking outside, eating noodles or using a vending machine. Try saying it before using useful phrase # 8. 3. =93Ara! Onara suru tsu-mori datta keh-do, un-chi ga de-chatta.=94 The literal translation of this useful phrase is =93Oops! I meant to fart but poop came out=94. Saying this useful phrase never gets old, especially in public places, especially on a first date and most especially if it=92s clearly one of only 10 Japanese phrases that you=92ve memorized. When in Southeast Asia, I especially enjoy muttering in Japanese about crapping my pants while walking past Japanese tourists. The reactions are priceless. 4. =93Mo da-meh. Yoh-para-chatta. Go-men.=94 At some point during your stay, Japanese people will probably try to make you drink past your limit. That=92s when this phrase comes in handy. It means something like, =93No more, I=92m already drunk, sorry.=94 Photo by Jenny Webber 5. =93Ko-ko wa do-ko? Wa-ta-shi wa da-reh?=94 Na-ni mo wah-kah-nai.=94 Where is this? Who am I? I don=92t understand anything. This is what you say after failing to use useful phrase # 4 in time. 6. =93Ee-show ni kah-rah-o-keh ni ee-koh ka?=94 Shall we go to karaoke together? This is a good line to use if trying to pick someone up from the bar. Think of karaoke as a transition point between the bar and the love hotel. Note =96 please don=92t pronounce karaoke with lots of EEE sounds. It should sound like =93kah-rah-o-keh=94 not =93carry-oh-key=94. 7. =93Hon-toe ni oh-ee-shee des yo!=94 Use this one when eating. It means something like, =93For real, it=92s deli= cious!=94 Hontou ni means =93for real=94 or =93really=94 or =93I=92m not kidding.=94 = Japanese people are always telling sweet little white lies, so dropping a =93hontou ni=94 from time to time is very much appreciated. 8. =93Ah-nah-tah wa ha-ruh no ee-chee ban no sah-ku-rah yo-ree u-tsu-ku-she= e.=94 This classic Japanese pick-up line means =93You=92re more beautiful than the first cherry blossom of spring.=94 <>9. =93Ni-hon dai-skee=94. Japan is the best. I love Japan. When in doubt, just smile, nod and repeat. 10. =93Koh-nah ni kee-ray na to-ko-ro wa hah-jee-meh-teh mee-tah!=94 Japanese people love it when you gush about their country. This phrase means, =93I=92ve never seen a place so beautiful before=94. Bust it out at famous attractions and you=92ll meet with instant approval. Add Comment "
1338363889.0	366.0	False	 While excellent sushi can certainly be had inside of the fish market proper,= most of the eateries close around noon, and there is always a mad rush of p= atrons competing for limited seating. So we recommend eating at either one o= f the sushi restaurants in the jogai-shijo (external market) or at one of th= e fine establishments in the surrounding neighborhoods of the Tsukiji distri= ct itself. Eating at the external market, located just a block away from where the auct= ions are held, provides a slightly less hectic atmosphere. Many of the sushi= joints here are open 24 hours, and the marketplace, with its countless litt= le stores selling every type of culinary ingredient imaginable, can be a fun= side attraction. Recommendations here include Sushi Sen (Akimoto building 1F, 6-23-12 Tsukiji= , Chuo-ku, tel. 03 3549 1136) which serves naturally-caught tuna at great pr= ices, and Sushi Ichiban (4-13-15 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, tel. 03 3524 7188), which= offers a superb traditional omakase course meal for two at under =C2=A54000= . Going beyond the market The alternative is to scope out the surrounding neighborhoods of Tsukiji, wh= ere satellite establishments of those in the market provide a more refined d= ining experience in a relaxed, modern milieu. This is a great chance share t= he air with salarymen getting off of work from surrounding offices and posh s= hoppers coming down off of a Ginza high. A favorite in this area is Tama Sushi (1-9-4 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, tel. 03 3541 1= 917), which lately has been offering a 'recession special' featuring tuna an= d other delicacies at serious discounts. Sushi Iwa (2-15-12 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku= , tel.03 3541 0655) located just across the street from the external market,= would never be called inexpensive -- but don't let that be a deterrent to s= topping in and enjoying even just a few pieces of what many call the best su= shi in town. Seeing the sites A leisurely riverside stroll is certainly the perfect way to end an evening o= f seafood dining in Tokyo's sushi capital.Favorite spots in the area include= Tsukiji Honganji, a True Pure Land sect Buddhist temple known throughout th= e city for its Indian-inspired stone architecture, and the Kachidoki Bridge,= a lovely short span (illuminated blue and green at night) that connects Tsu= kiji with the man-made islands on the other side of the Sumida River.

1338814717.0	49039.0	True	Hey dad, I'm loving bejing. I found some ray bans at a market the other day, but the people were very difficult to negotiate with and the quality of the ray bans was nowhere near as good as in hong kong. im going to visit a different market tomorrow and see what i can find. I did buy 20 before leaving Hong Kong for 55 HKD each. i dont think i will be able to fit 200 ray bans in my suitcase though so i might ship it to your address. My suitcase is a bit full. Anyways, my flight back to the US leaves the day after tomorrow. Also, a friend asked me if you know the owners of Lincoln Hall in Chicago. Talk to you soon! Nelson 
1338898206.0	52905.0	True	I found some really good fakes here in Beijing but also a bit pricey. They were 100rmb if I bought 100. ($16.5 each) They were heavy (made of metal and glass) and they weren't painted on like the Hong Kong ones. But when I went to withdraw money, the atm only let me withdraw 3000rmb and they wouldn't give me the same price for only 40. It costs me $5 to withdraw money here so I only got one for myself with a prescription. It cost 300rmb for the high quality ray bans with prescription lenses about $48. Anyways, this market was fantastic and i wish I had more time but they closed at 7pm and I leave tomorrow. They had some Georgio Armani leather bags that I swear were stolen from the factory. I also bought a little box of 10 cohiba minis for 50rmb ($8). I'll be back in the us tomorrow so ill call you with a real phone. Nelson

If succesfully called, this method will return a `User` JSON object representing the user that just logged in. If the given username and password are invalid an HTTP 401 response will be returned with the `WWW-Authenitcate` header set to the value `password`. This method must be called before any other method can be called. If either `username` or `password` are not provided, or they are empty strings, an HTTP 400 response will be returned ## [GET] /restapi/restaurants/latitude/longitude/{?radius=search_radius&max_results=max_search_results} Based on the latitude and longitude parameters, this method returns a JSON Array of nearby Restaurant Location JSON Objects which are sorted by their distance from the given location. If no nearby restauruants are found an empty JSON array will be returned. An optional `radius` parameter may be specified, thus indicating the desired search radius for the query. The radius should be specified in kilometers. If no radius is specified, the server will fallback to it's own desired default. An optional `max_results` parameter may be specified, thus indicating the desired maximum results for the server to return. If the server finds the specified radius unaccepatable (i.e. it's too big or too small), an HTTP 406 response will be returned with the header `X-Not-Acceptable-Reason` set to `Bad Radius`. The response will also contain a JSON object indicating the range (in dijkstra notation) of acceptable radii. The JSON object will have the following form: { ""min_radius"" : Minimum search radius in kilometers (inclusive), ""max_radius"" : Maximum search radius in kilometers (exclusive) } "

1341000057.0	71203.0	True	Hey guys, Ive got some questions so sorry for the long email! lol...So first, we have all of these restaurants in the database and they don't have locations just yet. I was just wondering why is it that they need locations to be on the app or is that just like the beta version? I put in a location for one of the Mcdonalds, so does that mean it will show up on the app next time? When we add more restaurants and stuff do they go directly onto the app say when were live or is that something that say I add 10 new restaurants, we have to do an update and then thats when they show up? Also for the app is there going to be like a tutorial to show the customer how to use the app? Also on the part where they create an account, there needs to be the part where they can check off the allergies that there allergic too and more importantly there needs to be a box where they check for the terms and agreements so that we can protect ourselves. Also, this is great for a soft launch so that I can actually pitch it now to people, but I'm not going to want to launch it until we have the full app ready to go (with the other buttons and stuff) How long do you guys think until we can get that done? Everything else is looking great and if I think of anymore questions Ill let you guys know! Thanks again for everything and hope you guys still have some free time to enjoy this summer! lol Henry On Fri, Jun 29, 2012 at 12:02 PM, Robert Pieta <robert.m.pieta@gmail.com>wrote: > Wonderful!

1341000057.0	79069.0	True	"Locations are necessary because thats how the backend knows which = restaurants to return. So when you update the location or add an = location on the backend, it will automatically send the correct data to = the app. No app update needed. There will be no tutorial on how to use the app. If one is needed, then = the app is designed wrong. In the mobile field, there should be no need for a tutorial, especially for an app as = simple as this. If I add all the allergies the on one screen for registration it will be = very clogged and hard to use. A user can remove/add allergies from the myAllergies tab. I think registration = should be super simple, and the ability to customize an account comes later. As far a deadline, I am still under the impression that my job ""ends"" = July 15th. I will have everything ready on my side at that time, and will send you the app and code that day as = well.

1341000057.0	79841.0	True	Henry, While a lot of the back end features are near finished, what you are actually seeing and interacting with on the app is about 20% done. There is still a tone of work left to do to make it a great user experience, both in the designs and in adding the functionality. Robert has a few more things to do and then him and I are going to meet to tighten up all the designs. The will likely be after next week, so we'd probably submit the first version to the app store on july 15 or so and it will be out in about a week. >From there, Robert will have updates which will take another week or so and then it should be usable for customers.

1341000057.0	82581.0	True	I disagree with Adam about the 20%. The only functionality not yet = implemented=20 is QR scan, and one remove/add allergy bug remains. Everything else = works and is there. Also, I aim to be done by July 15th. That is the deadline I was given at = the beginning of the project. I will finish functionality side (QR and fix the bug) in = the next few days. Then Adam an I will tighten the designs, and you have a few days to play = and test the app. Ill fix any bugs that remain.=20 (So Adam, when do you want to meet?) Also, as far as app store submission, my account is tied to my business. = Henry will need to get his own account to host Eatible. This is better for many reasons = (separation of apps,=20 he can view the downloads without needing to email me, he can update app = info, ect).=20 I'll be happy to put the first version up for him.=20 After July 15th Ill have to focus on a different project I am working = on, for a Psych professor at U of I.

1342536215.0	1870.0	True	"Hi Nelson, No worries, I look forward to working with you! I just wasn't sure what was going on with the android app, I'm looking to launch around August and I just wanted to see how things were going? I know for apple that you have to submit it and then also pay $100 a year for it, is that the same for Android? Can you help me to sign up with Android so it can be under my name? Also, I've talked with Robert and Kurtis about the coding. Pretty much I'm just going to need you to sign a contract pretty much just saying that I own the work...as Robert explained to me, the code that you write for it you might have used in other apps or will use so you can still use that, but pretty much you can't use the code to make another allergy app etc. let me know what you think? Also, is there a way I can download a beta version before we release it? I have the apple one right now and Robert is using test flight. My number is 847-337-0193, feel free to give me a call anytime!

1344266876.0	31743.0	True	Hey, The main screen just adds another click that the user need in order to get to what he wants. If the user wants to see a list of nearby restaurants, then it is 0 clicks (just the login). But if he wants to do a QR scan then it will be 1 click. However, I thought we removed the QR functionality since I haven't received any info about how it works with the API. If we add a main screen, then it is 1 click to get to nearby restaurants and 1 click to do a QR scan. Anyways, I fixed the registration, and added some more features. As for the layouts, yes I got the PDFs. I don't have the app icon that its supposed to be.

1353690117.0	3827.0	False	Lee!!! are you going monday? Make sure you know linked lists: traversal, deletions, addition Tree traversal, in order, pre order, post order. depth first search, breadth first search HASHMAPS! recursion! Ask clarifying questions, sometimes they don't tell you everything about a problem so you have to ask them for more details. Get a naive solution before you go on to a faster one or at least explain to them the naive solution. relax. Remember to discuss your solution as you think of it or code it. It's probably better to talk to much than too little. Almost all of their questions are going to be very standard (straight out of cracking the coding interview) so read that or check online for common interview questions. I can give you some if you need. And then you will probably get one question that is a bit harder just talk a lot and theyll usually give you hints. Anyways, good luck! I hope you get it!

1380403096.0	119442.0	False	Oh I see. I tried enabling the app for the Huawei U8180 in my play store developer console but google won't allow me. I believe it is because I did not create assets for small screen devices. It should, however still work perfectly on these devices. You are welcome to pull the app from one phone and install it on another. If you have adb installed on your computer you can just plug your phone in and type. adb pull /data/app/com.nelson.gpsenable then plug in the other phone and type adb install com.nelson.gpsenable the instructions vary by phone.

1384381778.0	20859.0	False	Hey, My background includes making a lot of android apps. Last summer I interned at Facebook where I worked on the Messenger for Android team. We worked on the 3.0 release. My intern projects included the new settings screen, expandable notifications, and the chat head inbox jewel. I'm looking to work on an Android app on a small team. I really love working with smart motivated people.

1384909982.0	1667.0	True	Hi, I'm in 1012 W clark apt 21. My toilet has recently started making a small trickle noise that stays for hours after I flush. I fear it is wasting water. What can I do about this? Cheers, Nelson 
1383093725.0	1874231.0	False	"Hey Nelson, Without further ado, here's our Android challenge. Let me know if you have any questions. Eliot Android Developer Challenge Design and implement a live wallpaper<http://android-developers.blogspot.de/2010/02/live-wallpapers.htm= l > for Android devices (2.1+). The goal is to display a waveform on the Android home screen, using data from the Soundcloud API <http://developers.soundcloud.com/>. Specification: The user installs the app on her phone. A new Live wallpaper is selectable. Once the user selects this wallpaper a (random) waveform is downloaded in the background and displayed on the user's home screen. The user can open the url of the track by interacting with the background. The wall paper should change automatically after a while, to another random track/waveform= . Requirements: - Android 2.1+ compatible. - Don't unnecessarily drain battery. - Make sure network settings are honoured. - Use the SoundCloud API to obtain the PNG with the waveform<http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference#tracks> (example <http://waveforms.soundcloud.com/KFe8oPQ1jmBR_m.png>). It could be a random waveform (maybe from the tracks of a specified user (/users/:name/tracks.{json,xml}), or from someones favourite tracks (/users/:name/favorites.{json,xml})), it does not matter. - The displayed waveforms should change from time to time (for example every hour, or after some user interaction). - The waveform should look nice, so some form of post-processing is probably needed. It should also fit the screen. Optional: the user should be able to interact with the screen background (e.g. double tapping), to open a browser with the corresponding track url. Optional: display the name of the track on the home screen. Any language which works on Android can be used.
